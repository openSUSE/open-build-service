Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation
instructions or use the OBS Appliance from

  http://openbuildservice.org/download

There is also an install medium which installs OBS on hard disk now.

dist/README.UPDATERS file has information for updaters.

OBS Appliance users who have setup their LVM can just replace
their appliance image without data loss. The migration will
happen automatically.
