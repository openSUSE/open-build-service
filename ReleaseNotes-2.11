WARNING:
WARNING: This is a development release, not for production usage!
WARNING:




Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation
instructions or use the OBS Appliance from

  http://openbuildservice.org/download/

There is also an install medium which installs OBS on hard disk now.

dist/README.UPDATERS file has information for updaters.

OBS Appliance users who have setup their LVM can just replace
their appliance image without data loss. The migration will
happen automatically.


Features
========

Generic:
 * Search was improved: New and updated projects/packages are indexed directly instead
   of once every hour. As configuration files for Thinking Sphinx were changed, running
   a 'ts:rt:rebuild' task is needed after deployment, as user wwwrun:
   'chroot --userspec=wwwrun:www / /bin/bash -c "cd /srv/www/obs/api/ && /usr/bin/bundle.ruby2.5 exec rails ts:rt:rebuild RAILS_ENV=production"'
 * Add the 'limit_for_search_results' configuration variable, to allow limiting the results
   returned by calls to API endpoints starting by '/search/...' and not ending in '.../id'.

User Interface:
 * Colors were adjusted to improve contrast thus improving readability
 * The diff box from requests are now being rendered with ruby and coderay instead of CodeMirror
 * New Terms link, configure the link target in the OBS configuration

Backend & build support:
 *

Breaking API changes:
=====================

 * Status messages endpoints. Check the API documentation for the new format.
 * Updated /distributions endpoints. Check the API documentation for the new format.
 * The API endpoint '/announcements' is deprecated and will be removed in the
   next version. Announcements can be created through Status Messages by using
   'announcement' severity. Check the API documentation about Status Messages.
 * The API endpoints '/statistics/download_counter', '/search/attribute' and '/statistics/newest_stats'
   have been removed. They have been non-functional or unused for a long time.
 * Messages (for projects/packages) removed. The API routes below '/message'
   were deprecated in the previous release. They are now removed.
 * Remove Ratings. The following API routes were already deprecated in the
   previous release, and are now removed:
   - GET /statistics/highest_rated?limit=<limit>
   - GET /statistics/rating/<project>/<package>
 * The API endpoints '/search/*' with the HTTP method POST are deprecated
   since they are exactly the same as their GET counterparts.
 * The LDAP connection feature has been temporarily removed. As a workaround,
   administrators can migrate to an authentication proxy setup.
