== Release Notes for openSUSE Build Service 1.0.0

Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation instructions.

README.UPDATE has informations for updaters.

Main new features are::

 * Submission request handling. It is possible to create, show, accept
   or decline a package submission from a project to another.
 * The source handling has improved for source links. Merged sources
   are checked out by default and the server creates a source link
   with changes on submission time.
 * The branch request creates a branch project from another one.
   This project builds against the branched one and has package(s)
   with source links inside.

Important Bugfixes::

 * Flag handling has been fixed for debuginfo flag in api and web frontend.
 * rpmlint call gots enabled, if configured in project config.
 * The publisher works out of the box now.
