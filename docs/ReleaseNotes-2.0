=== Known Regressions:

* read access feature enhancements of MeeGo branch (named 1.8 in git)
  are not included with this release. 

  Do *NOT* update from 1.8 to this release.

  We will merge these branches in a later release.


* API calls which got deprecated with 1.0 release got removed:
----
  /platform       (use /build or /search/repository_id instead)
  /repository     (use /build or /search/repository_id instead)
  /project        (use /source instead)
  /package        (use /source instead)
----

* The OBS Appliance comes with package signing enabled by default now.
  As consequence some operations like project creation may take a
  long time if your hardware has no hardware random number generator.
  (gpg key creation needs a safe random generator source).

* Anonymous access mode for webui +
  => to be configured in api  config/options.yml
