== Open Build Service 2.8

WARNING: This is a development release, not for production usage!




Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation
instructions or use the OBS Appliance from

http://openbuildservice.org/download/

There is also an install medium with installs OBS on hard disc now.

dist/README.UPDATERS file has informations for updaters.

OBS Appliance users who have setup their LVM can just replace
their appliance image without data loss. The migration will
happen automatically.

   the target package of a request

               of creating local links

=== Wanted changes:

 * kiwi builds: build configuration changes from the project where the kiwi
                file is stored have always an effect now.

 * maintenance_release requests are locking only the source packages on
   creation now. They don't lock the patchinfos. The project gets locked on release
   now.

 * service wrapper script for LXC got replaced by a docker alternative

=== Other changes

 * Server side pagination on user show page for improving the performance.

 * The way to identify spiders got changed. A separate configuration via
   apache is no longer required. See the Administration Guide.

 * Frontend stack is using ruby 2.4 and rails 5.0.1 now

=== Notes for systems using systemd:

OBS is using init scripts, not systemd style .service files. This will stay until
we will switch from SLES 11 to SLES 12 as default production platform.

openSUSE installations may use systemd (instead of sysvinit) and it should work
in general. Not working are usages like

 # rcobssrcserver status

You will only get the systemd status here.

Also stopping services may not kill all processes, which leads to abstract errors
when trying to restart them. We heard also about trashed MySQL databases when using
systemd.

To avoid these problems you need switch directory to avoid the systemd mapper:

 # cd /etc/init.d
 # ./obssrcserver status|stop|start

vim: syntax=asciidoc
