# Open Build Service 2.4
#

Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation
instructions or use the OBS Appliance from

  http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/OBS-Appliance

There is also an install medium with installs OBS on hard disc now.

dist/README.UPDATERS file has informations for updaters.

OBS Appliance users who have setup their LVM can just replace 
their appliance image without data loss. The migration will 
happen automatically.


Temporary Problems:
===================

 * No gui interface for managing users and groups. api
   routes have to be enhanced and webui needs to get support 
   for using it.

Changes on purpose:
===================

 * Migration to Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.2

 * request database got move from backend to the api. Directly
   after update all requests seem to have vanished, but a delayed
   job is importing them again. This can take some hours dependening
   on the amount of requests.

 * package meta of package copy command is not copying 
   relationships and devel definitions anymore

 * Requests do require a description now in any case

 * webui configurations got moved from environments/*.rb to config/options.yml.
   TODO: import config settings on update

 * Build Prerequires can be used also with the FileProvides feature in the
   build configuration now.

 * Regular users can copy entire projects (without binary results) now.

 * Upload of binaries via api is allowed to administrators now.

Features
========

 * Arch Linux package format support got added.

 * Build Job Constraints handling. It can be used to define build
   instance requirements for certain build jobs. Either for defined
   package sources or for all repositories.

   Documentation about this can be found here:

    http://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-reference-guide/cha.obs.build_job_constraints.html

 * Support of preinstall images, which can be used to speed up build
   jobs. They need to be build manually, but get automatically used for
   creating a build instance base in a faster way than just with installing
   packages.

 * Static links (without version and release numbers) for binary results 
   in the published repositories can be configured now. This can be done via
   the "staticlinks" keyword in Repotype: definition.

 * Data about used resources of build jobs get collected. However it
   gets not yet used for build job assignment

 * Requests can be listed also for given groups now.

 * Checkout of delete packages does not require a srcmd5 sum anymore.

 * Delete Requests can be used to request deletion of repositories from 
   a project.

 * Support of creation of application data xml which can be used for app 
   stores for application centric browsing versus package browsing.

 * Support hugetable memory usage for kvm workers.

 * Support building cross build formats, eg. building an rpm with a kiwi 
   build description or an deb package via a .spec file.

 * Efficient transport of product build results from worker to backend.

Deprecated:
===========

The following calls have been marked as deprecated, they will get removed in OBS 3.0

* api
  - /person/$LOGIN/group   -> use /group?login=$LOGIN   instead
  - /search/project_id     -> use /search/project/id    instead
  - /search/package_id     -> use /search/package/id    instead
