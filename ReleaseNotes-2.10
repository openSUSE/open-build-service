# Open Build Service 2.10
#

WARNING:
WARNING: This is a development release, not for production usage!
WARNING:




Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation
instructions or use the OBS Appliance from

  http://openbuildservice.org/download/

There is also an install medium which installs OBS on hard disk now.

dist/README.UPDATERS file has information for updaters.

OBS Appliance users who have setup their LVM can just replace
their appliance image without data loss. The migration will
happen automatically.


Features
========

Generic:

Frontend:
 * Improved UI/UX for package live build log:
    * Show a hint to know what is happening.
    * Clicking on the hint can starts or stop the loading of the content.
 * Do not show excluded entries in package build results by default.
 * Microsoft Azure cloud upload support
 * API routes for Amazon ec2 cloud feature
 * Refactored the view of the binaries page that before was just a list of links that
   pointed to the details page. Now you can download the files and upload images to
   the cloud directly from here.
 * Text fields are stored as 4 byte UTF-8 which allows to use emojis. To use this
   feature, switch database.yml to utf8mb4 encoding
 * Admins can write Terms of Services, via the API, and they will be shown in the WebUI to
   users unless they acknowledge them.

Backend:

Shipment:

Bugfixes:

  * Binary view now shows correct data for multibuild packages
  * Source diffs with mixed encoding were causing failures when processing notification
    mails. This is fixed now.
  * Improved explanatory text for role changes on request review page.
  * Rails security update was patched (CVE-2019-5419).
  * Added upper-limit to range to avoid long running queries in Webui::MonitorController.
  * In WebUI, only admins are allowed to create DoD repositories.
  * In WebUI, only admins are allowed to create sourceaccess/access repositories flags.
  * Added missing authorization to move repository path in Webui::ProjectController.
  * Require sourceaccess by default in `require_package`.


Intentional changes:
====================

  * The format of the OBS options.yml is now distinguishing between Rails environments.
    You can convert your old configuration by running:
      (cd /srv/www/obs/api/; rake migrate_options_yml)

  * Excluded entries in package build results are not shown by default anymore.

  * OBS is now using the lograge gem to generate production logs. We are now logging (in one line per request):
    * Timestamp
    * Request: Method + Controller + Action + Path + Params
    * Response status
    * Duration: Overall / View / DB
    * Remote IP
    * User login

  You can see an example of the output here:
    ```
    method=POST path=/comments format=js controller=Webui::CommentsController action=create status=200 duration=1436.57 view=77.25 db=13.92 params={"utf8"=>"✓", "commentable_type"=>"Project", "commentable_id"=>"1", "comment"=>{"body"=>"hola que tal"}, "commit"=>"Add comment"} host=127.0.0.1 time=2018-05-14 15:59:03 +0000 user=Admin
    ```

    This will condense the output generated, before it was something like this:

    ```
    Started POST "/" for 127.0.0.1 at 2012-03-10 14:28:14 +0100
    Processing by HomeController#index as HTML
      Rendered text template within layouts/application (0.0ms)
      Rendered layouts/_assets.html.erb (2.0ms)
      Rendered layouts/_top.html.erb (2.6ms)
      Rendered layouts/_about.html.erb (0.3ms)
      Rendered layouts/_google_analytics.html.erb (0.4ms)
    Completed 200 OK in 79ms (Views: 78.8ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms)
    ```
 * In previous releases it was possible to delete attributes through
   /source/<project>/_attribute/?namespace=OBS&name=VeryImportantProject (or similiar
   for packages). You need to follow the documentation now and the proper
   route is /source/<project>/_attribute/OBS:VeryImportantProject

 * GET '/attribute/:attribute' route responded with a 400 when the attribute type
   did not exist. It now returns a 404 status.

 * GET '/source/<project>/_attribute' allowed to filter by namespace. This was never
   documented and was removed now. '/_attribute' will return all attributes, while
   '/_attribute/:attribute' keeps returning only the given attribute (as documented)

 * Public routes for status messages have been dropped. Dropped routes:
   - GET 'public/status/delete_message'
   - GET 'public/status/list_messages'
   - GET 'public/status/show_message'
   - GET 'public/status/update_messages'
   - GET 'public/status/save_new_message'
   - GET 'public/status/delete_message'

  * The 'commenter' and 'commenters' payload of Comment events used to contain user ids.
    They now contain the user login name instead.
    Run the data migrations to convert events in the old format:
    'rails data:migrate RAILS_ENV=production'

  * Messages (for projects/packages) deprecated. The API routes
    below /message/ are deprecated and will be removed in the next
    version.

  * Deprecated Ratings. The following API routes are deprecated and will be removed
    in the next version:
    - GET /statistics/highest_rated?limit=<limit>
    - GET /statistics/rating/<project>/<package>
    - PUT /statistics/rating/<project>/<package>

Other changes
=============


Notes for systems using systemd:
================================

OBS is using init scripts, not systemd style .service files. This will stay until
we will switch from SLES 11 to SLES 12 as default production platform.

openSUSE installations may use systemd (instead of sysvinit) and it should work
in general. Not working are usages like:

 # rcobssrcserver status

You will only get the systemd status here.

Also stopping services may not kill all processes, which leads to abstract errors
when trying to restart them. We heard also about trashed MySQL databases when using
systemd.

To avoid these problems you need switch directory to avoid the systemd mapper:

 # cd /etc/init.d
 # ./obssrcserver status|stop|start
