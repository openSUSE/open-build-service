get:
  summary: List channel objects that match a XPath condition.
  description: |
    Return a collection of channel objects that match a XPath condition.

    This operation is the same as the one defined with `GET /search/channel/binary` with the exception of the results returned.
    While the former operation returns a list of channel objects with release information, this one only returns a list of channel
    objects with the channel definition related to the binary.
    See example values of a succeeded request below.
