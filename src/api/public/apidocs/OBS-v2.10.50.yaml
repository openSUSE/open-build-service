      All endpoints besides the owner search listed in the search group use Xpath expressions. The `match` query parameter is used
      to pass the Xpath predicate. The individual endpoints refer to different objects like Packages, Projects, Issues and more...
      Please refer to the documentation of the individual search endpoints to know which attributes can be accessed through the predicate,
      and which extra query parameters are supported or might be required in order to run the search.


      These functions can be used with the predicates: `boolean`, `contains`, `not`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`.

      _Example_:

      For a list of all projects where the name starts with "OBS:".

      `/search/project?match=starts_with(@name,'OBS:')`


      More than one predicate can be combined with the following operators: `eq`, `and`, `or`, `neq`, `gt`, `lt`, `gteq`, `lteq`.

      _Example_:

      To receive details about the package "obs-server" that is part of the project "OBS:Server:Unstable".

      `/search/package?match=@name='obs-server'+and+@project='OBS:Server:Unstable'`

    The _Open Build Service API_ is an XML API. To make sure you are querying the API and not the Web User Interface, provide the `Accept: application/xml; charset=utf-8` header in your API requests.

    To authenticate, use [HTTP basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) by passing the _Authorization_ header in the form of `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`.

    There is no API versioning, since there is no need for it right now.

    Only rudimentary rate limiting is implemented, so please be gentle when using the API concurrently, especially with potentially expensive operations.

    Your OBS Admin might have implemented other authentication schemes or stricter rate limiting in front of the application. Check the [site main page](/) for details.

    For command-line users, we recommend using [osc](https://github.com/openSUSE/osc) with its _api_ command to interact with the API.
    It's as simple as this example: `osc api /about` (_about_ is one of the endpoints documented below)

    In order to make sure that the XML that is send in a requests body is in the expected format, the API validates it.
    Either against a XML Schema Definition (`.xsd`) or a RELAX NG Schema (`.rng`). The schemas are mentioned
    in the endpoint documentation. If there is no schema file mentioned, no validation of the XML is done.
    In case the XML is not valid, a validation error is reported.
