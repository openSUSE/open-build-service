*SVN*

-----
1.1.2

- Added better fix to version checking (Ticket #130, jdell@gbdev.com).
- Fixed generated init_engine.rb so that VERSION module doesn't cause probems (Ticket #131, japgolly@gmail.com)
- Fixed error with Rails 1.0 when trying to ignore the engine_schema_info table (Ticket #132, snowblink@gmail.com)
- Re-added old style rake tasks (Ticket #133)
- No longer adding all subdirectories of <engine>/app or <engine>/lib, as this can cause issues when files are grouped in modules (Ticket #149, kasatani@gmail.com)
- Fixed engine precidence ordering for Rails 1.1 (Ticket #146)
- Added new Engines.each method to assist in processing the engines in the desired order (Ticket #146)
- Fixed annoying error message at appears when starting the console in development mode (Ticket #134)
- Engines is now super-careful about loading the correct version of Rails from vendor (Ticket #154)

-----
1.1.1

- Fixed migration rake task failing when given a specific version (Ticket #115)
- Added new rake task "test:engines" which will test engines (and other plugins) but ensure that the test database is cloned from development beforehand (Ticket #125)
- Fixed issue where 'engine_schema_info' table was included in schema dumps (Ticket #87)
- Fixed multi-part emails (Ticket #121)
- Added an 'install.rb' file to new engines created by the bundled generator, which installs the engines plugin automatically if it doesn't already exist (Ticket #122)
- Added a default VERSION module to generated engines (Ticket #123)
- Refactored copying of engine's public files to a method of an Engine instance. You can now call Engines.get(:engine_name).copy_public_files (Ticket #108)
- Changed engine generator templates from .rb files to .erb files (Ticket #106)
- Fixed the test_helper.erb file to use the correct testing extensions and not load any schema - the schema will be cloned automatically via rake test:engines
- Fixed problem when running with Rails 1.1.1 where version wasn't determined correctly (Ticket #129)
- Fixed bug preventing engines from loading when both Rails 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 gems are installed and in use.
- Updated version (d'oh!)


-----
1.1.0

- Improved regexp matching for Rails 1.0 engines with peculiar paths
- Engine instance objects can be accessed via Engines[:name], an alias for Engines.get(:name) (Ticket #99)
- init_engine.rb is now processed as the final step in the Engine.start process, so it can access files within the lib directory, which is now in the $LOAD_PATH at that point. (Ticket #99)
- Clarified MIT license (Ticket #98)
- Updated Rake tasks to integrate smoothly with Rails 1.1 namespaces
- Changed the version to "1.1.0 (svn)"
- Added more information about using the plugin with Edge Rails to the README
- moved extensions into lib/engines/ directory to enable use of Engines module in extension code.
- Added conditional require_or_load method which attempts to detect the current Rails version. To use the Edge Rails version of the loading mechanism, add the line:
    Engines.config :edge, true
  to your environment.rb file.
- Merged changes from /branches/edge and /branches/rb_1.0 into /trunk
- engine_schema_info now respects the prefix/suffixes set for ActiveRecord::Base (Ticket #67)
- added ActiveRecord::Base.wrapped_table_name(name) method to assist in determining the correct table name


-----
1.0.6

- Added ability to determine version information for engines: rake engine_info
- Added a custom logger for the Engines module, to stop pollution of the Rails logs.
- Added some more tests (in particular, see rails_engines/applications/engines_test).
- Another attempt at solving Ticket #53 - controllers and helpers should now be loadable from modules, and if a full path (including RAILS_ROOT/ENGINES_ROOT) is given, it should be safely stripped from the require filename such that corresponding files can be located in any active engines. In other words, controller/helper overloading should now completely work, even if the controllers/helpers are in modules.
- Added (finally) patch from Ticket #22 - ActionMailer helpers should now load
- Removed support for Engines.start :engine, :engine_name => 'whatever'. It was pointless.
- Fixed engine name referencing; engine_stylesheet/engine_javascript can now happily use shorthand engine names (i.e. :test == :test_engine) (Ticket #45)
- Fixed minor documentation error ('Engine.start' ==> 'Engines.start') (Ticket #57)
- Fixed double inclusion of RAILS_ROOT in engine_migrate rake task (Ticket #61)
- Added ability to force config values even if given as a hash (Ticket #62)


-----
1.0.5

- Fixed bug stopping fixtures from loading with PostgreSQL


-----
1.0.4

- Another attempt at loading controllers within modules (Ticket #56)


-----
1.0.3

- Fixed serious dependency bug stopping controllers being loaded (Ticket #56)


-----
1.0.2

- Fixed bug with overloading controllers in modules from /app directory
- Fixed exception thrown when public files couldn't be created; exception is now logged (Ticket #52)
- Fixed problem with generated test_helper.rb file via File.expand_path (Ticket #50)


-----
1.0.1

- Added engine generator for creation of new engines
- Fixed 'Engine' typo in README
- Fixed bug in fixtures extensions
- Fixed /lib path management bug
- Added method to determine public directory location from Engine object
- Fixed bug in the error message in get_engine_dir()
- Added proper component loading
- Added preliminary tests for the config() methods module


-----
pre-v170

- Fixed copyright notices to point to DHH, rather than me.
- Moved extension require statements into lib/engines.rb, so the will be loaded if another module/file calls require 'engines
- Added a CHANGELOG file (this file)
