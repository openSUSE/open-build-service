        * Patch by Kieran P for disabling persistent job queue and its polling.

        * Commit patch by P Baker, related to scheduling a persistent task at specified time. For example:
        MiddleMan(:hello_worker).enq_some_task(:arg => "hello_world",
                        :job_key => "boy",:scheduled_at => (Time.now + 1.hour))

        * Added TestCases for Cron Triggers, Meta Workers and stuff. We are heading towards proper code coverage with specs.

        * Added preliminary support for starting a worker on demand through scheduler. What it means is, when you have a worker which is getting
        scheduled very less frequently and you don't want the worker to persist, you can ask BackgrounDRb to restart the worker on each schedule.

        * Fixed some unreported issues with writing data to socket between workers and stuff.

        * Fixed issues with too many open connections, because connections were not getting closed. BackgrounDRb now opens only one connection, which is
        reused throughout the lifecycle of rails application.

        * Fixed all outstanding issues with Cron triggers, BackgrounDRb now explicitly depends on "chronic" gem.

        * Removed Framework directory and BackgrounDRb now explicitly depends on packet gem.
