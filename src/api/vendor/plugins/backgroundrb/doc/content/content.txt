*BackgrounDRb* is a Ruby job server and scheduler. Its main intent is to be
used with Ruby on Rails applications for offloading long-running tasks.
Since a Rails application blocks while serving a request it is best to
move long-running tasks off into a background process that is divorced
from http request/response cycle.

%(entry-title)<a name="installation"> Installation </a>%

p(sub-title). Installing the dependencies :

As of version 1.0.4 _BackgrounDRb_ depends on _chronic_ and _packet_ gems. Thus lets get
started by installing these two gems:

<pre class="boxed">sudo gem install chronic packet </pre>

Please note that, this version of _BackgrounDRb_ needs packet version 0.1.7 or greater, so make
sure you have that.

p(sub-title). Getting the code from Subversion :

<pre class="boxed"> svn co http://svn.devjavu.com/backgroundrb/trunk </pre>

p(sub-title). Installing from Git:

As of version 1.0.4 __BackgrounDRb__ development has moved to <a href="http://github.com/gnufied/backgroundrb/tree/master">github</a>. Above SVN url
will always mirror stable releases from Git. However to enjoy latest and greatest of features
you can install the plugin from git:

<pre class="multiline">
git clone git://github.com/gnufied/backgroundrb.git </pre>

<p style="text-decoration: line-through;"> Also for running git version of BackgrounDRb you will need, git version of packet.</p>

p(sub-title). Installation using Piston

<pre class="boxed">piston import http://svn.devjavu.com/backgroundrb/trunk/ backgroundrb </pre>

%(entry-title)<a name="configuration"> Configuration </a>%

After getting the plugin, you must copy it into your vendor/plugins and
then configure it for use. _BackgrounDRb_ comes with a rake task for
automating plugin configuration. Before running rake task, remove if
any old @backgroundrb@ or @load_worker_env.rb@ script is there in script folder of your rails
app after that run, following command from root directory of your
rails application:

<pre class="boxed">rake backgroundrb:setup </pre>

Above Command does following things :

*(content_list) Creates a config file @backgroundrb.yml@ in config directory of your rails application.
* Creates @RAILS_ROOT/lib/workers@ directory for keeping BackgrounDRb workers in one place.
* Creates @RAILS_ROOT/test/bdrb_test_helper.rb@ as a test helper for your workers
* Creates migration required for creating persistent job queue table.

After above make sure, that generated migration is ran using:

<pre class="boxed">rake db:migrate </pre>

p(sub-title). Configuration Options

A default @backgroundrb.yml@ file looks like this:

<pre class="multiline">
:backgroundrb:
  :port: 11006
  :ip: 0.0.0.0 </pre>

However, various other configuration options are available. For example, to load @production@
environment in your workers:

<pre class="multiline">
:backgroundrb:
  :port: 11006
  :ip: 0.0.0.0
  :environment: production </pre>


Following file demonstrates other available configuration options:

<pre class="multiline">
---
:backgroundrb:
  :port: 11006 # port to start listen
  :ip: localhost # host to listen
  :environment: production # rails environment to load
  :log: foreground # foreground mode,print log messages on console
  :debug_log: false # disable log workers and other logging
  :persistent_disabled: false # turn this off if your application doesn't use backgroundrb's persistent/enqueued tasks system
  :persistent_delay: 10 # the time (seconds) between each time backgroundrb checks the database for enqueued tasks
:schedules: # optional task scheduling
  : # look in scheduling section </pre>

%(entry-title)<a name="worker"> Workers </a>%

Once you are set with initial configuration, you can proceed to create worker and start
_BackgrounDRb_ server. To generate a worker:

<pre class="boxed"> ./script/generate worker billing </pre>

Output will look something like:

<pre class="multiline">exists  lib/workers/
create  lib/workers/billing_worker.rb </pre>

And generated worker will look like:

<pre class="multiline">class BillingWorker < BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker
  set_worker_name :billing_worker
  def create(args = nil)
    # method gets called, when new instance of worker is created.
   end
  end </pre>


You can define worker specific initialization in @create@ method. Tasks that are to be executed
in this worker should be defined as seperate methods. For example:

<pre class="multiline">class BillingWorker < BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker
  set_worker_name :billing_worker
  def create(args = nil)
    # this method is called, when worker is loaded for the first time
  end

  def charge_customer(customer_id = nil)
    logger.info 'charging customer now'
  end
end </pre>

%(entry-title)<a name="invoking_tasks"> Invoking Tasks </a>%

Task @charge_customer@ defined in @BillingWorker@ can be invoked in several ways. To beging with
it can be invoked from rails or can be scheduled to execute at particular interval using
cron like syntax.

p(sub-title). Invoking Task from Rails :

In your Rails controllers you have access to proxy class @MiddleMan@ which can be used
to interact with BackgrounDRb server, either from Rails controllers/Models or from Rails console.
For example to invoke @charge_customer@ method asychronously one can use:

<pre class="boxed">MiddleMan.worker(:billing_worker).async_charge_customer(:arg => current_customer.id) </pre>

Above code can be also executed from Rails console.

p(sub-title). Start the BackgrounDRb server :

You can use:

<pre class="boxed">./script/backgroundrb start </pre>

For more options:

<pre class="boxed">./script/backgroundrb --help </pre>

As documented above, you can use @backgroundrb.yml@ file to load different rails environments, however you can use:

<pre class="boxed">./script/backgroundrb -e development </pre>
