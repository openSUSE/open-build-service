%(entry-title)<a name="introduction"> Workers </a>%

Workers are your building blocks of Asynchronous Task Processing. An empty auto generated worker looks like this:

<pre class="multiline">class BillingWorker < BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker
  set_worker_name :billing_worker
  def create(args = nil)
    # method gets called, when new instance of worker is created.
  end
end </pre>

@set_worker_name@ will set the worker name which can be later used while invoking tasks on the worker.
@create@ method gets called when worker is loaded for the first time. If you are starting your worker
from rails, you can pass arguments to @create@ method using:

<pre class="multiline">MiddleMan.new_worker(:worker => :billing_worker,\
     :worker_key => user_session,:data => current_user.id) </pre>

p(sub-title). Using Workers

You can invoke random tasks on workers from rails or you can schedule them using config file. Look into
"Scheduling":/scheduling/index.html section for scheduling and "Rails Integration":/rails/index.html section
for invoking worker tasks from rails.

p(sub-title). Inbuilt instance methods available in your workers:

*(content_list) @cache@ : Can be used to store random results from worker which can be later retrieved from rails. For example:
  <pre class="boxed"> cache[key] = some_data </pre>
* @add_timer@ : Look in scheduler section
* @add_periodic_timer@ : Look in scheduler section
* @thread_pool@ : Look below
* @connect@: Look in "Advanced":/advanced/index.html section. Used to connect to external TCP/IP servers.
* @start_server@: Look in "Advanced":/advanced/index.html section. Used to start TCP/IP server from worker.
* @send_data@: Can be used to send objects to master process. You can ignore this method.
* @job_key@: When you invoke a task from rails by passing a job_key, that job_key can be accessed in workers with @job_key@. For example:
  From rails:
  <pre class="boxed"> MiddleMan.worker(:foo_worker).async_some_task(:arg => urls,
    :job_key => current_user[:id])</pre>
  Now this @job_key@ can be accessed inside workers with:
  <pre class="multiline">class FooWorker < BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker
    def some_task urls
      .. do some work with urls ..
      cache[job_key] = result
    end
  end</pre>

p(sub-title). Options via class methods :

Following class methods are available for further tuning of workers:

*(content_list) @pool_size@ : Can be used to control thread pool size. Accepts pool size as integer value.
* @set_no_auto_load@ : Can be used to disable auto loading of workers when _BackgrounDRb_ starts. Accepts true or false.
* @reload_on_schedule@ : Can be used to enable reloading of worker at scheduled execution time. Accepts true or false.
* @set_worker_name@ : Can be used to set worker name. Accepts symbol as worker name.

Following snippet demonstrates their usages:

<pre class="multiline">class HelloWorker < BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker
  set_worker_name :hello_worker
  reload_on_schedule true
  pool_size 10
end</pre>

When @reload_on_schedule@ is true, worker won't be loaded while _BackgrounDRb_ starts and hence you don't need
@set_no_auto_load@ option there.

%(entry-title)<a name="thread_pool"> Using Thread Pool </a>%

Remember _BackgrounDRb_ follows event model of network programming, but sad truth of life is not all networking
libraries follow this model and hence they make use of blocking IO and threads. BackgrounDRb allows you to run
all such tasks concurrently in threads which are internally managed by BackgrounDRb thread pool.

Each worker has access to object @thread_pool@ which can be used to run task in a thread concurrently.

<pre class="boxed">thread_pool.defer(:scrap_wikipedia,scrap_url) </pre>

So whatever code you write within @scrap_wikipedia@ method is going to run concurrently.

*WARNING*: Many of the Ruby libraries out there aren't thread safe and they may not
work as advertised when used from threads(example: Mechanize,Scrubyt)

%(entry-title)<a name="result_caching"> Result Caching </a>%

<b>Update : </b> <em>Using MemCache to store result objects is strongly recommended. Inbuilt cache works, but may give
unpredictable results. Also, using Memcache serves as an out of process cache, which can be queried at any time.
If your worker is doing some processing, inbuilt cache may not return result until worker picks up that request.</em>


All workers can cache results using @cache@ attribute. This result object can be then
queried from rails using @ask_result@. For example:

<pre class="multiline">class ProgressWorker < BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker
  set_worker_name :progress_worker
  def create
    @counter = 0
    add_periodic_timer(2) { increment_counter }
  end
  def increment_counter
    @counter += 1
    cache[some_key] = counter
  end
end</pre>

And using @MiddleMan@ proxy, you can keep querying the status of progress bar :

<pre class="boxed">MiddleMan.worker(:progress_worker).ask_result(some_key)</pre>

By default, @cache@ is a worker local hash like object, which is used for storing results.
But if you plan to store lots of objects in cache from your worker, it may not be an
optimal solution. You can easily replace in-worker cache with memcache.

You need to change @backgroundrb.yml@ file like this, for using memcache for object caching:

<pre class="multiline">:backgroundrb:
  :ip: 0.0.0.0
  :port: 11006
  :result_storage: memcache

:memcache: "10.0.0.1:11211,10.0.0.2:11211" </pre>

Everything else remains the same.

%(entry-title)<a name="persistent_job">Persistent Task Queue </a>%

BackgrounDRb now have out of box support for persistent job queues which are persisted to the
database. API to add a task in the job_queue is pretty simple:

<pre class="boxed">MiddleMan(:hello_worker).enq_some_task(:arg => "hello_world",:job_key => "boy")</pre>

So in your hello worker:

<pre class="multiline">
class HelloWorker
  def some_task args
    .. do some work ..
    persistent_job.finish! #=> marks the job as finished. totally thread safe
  end
end</pre>

@persistent_job@ is a thread local variable and will refer to currently
running queued task can be used from thread pool as well. For example:

<pre class="multiline">
class HelloWorker
  def some_task args
    thread_pool.defer(:fetch_url,args)
  end
   def fetch_url tags
    .. runs in thread ..
    .. fetch tasks ..
    persistent_job.finish!
  end
end</pre>


%(entry-title)<a name="worker_testing">Testing Workers </a>%

_BackgrounDRb_ comes with a baked in mechanism to write test cases. First make sure that you
have bdrb_test_helper.rb in the test directory of your rails app (run @rake backgroundrb:setup@, if you dont have one).

Just put your worker test cases in test/unit directory of your rails application and require the helper. Now, you should be good to go.

<pre class="multiline">require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/../bdrb_test_helper")
require "god_worker"
 context "When god worker starts" do
  setup do
    god_worker = GodWorker.new
  end
end </pre>

All above helper file does is that it stubs out, relevant worker methods, which really need network IO.
There can be methods added, which aren't stubbed, for all such methods you are encouraged to stub them and send
the patch to the backgroundrb mailing list.
