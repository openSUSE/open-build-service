= MigrationDataDumper

=== Motivation

The Rails migration system is great, but while it addresses schema changes wonderfully, it does nothing to preserve the all important data.

=== Solution

This plugin adds the methods +save_table_to_fixture+ and +restore_table_from_fixture+ to ActiveRecord::Migration, which dump and restore the data from the specified table.  The data is saved into a fixture file named after the table under <tt>#{RAILS_ROOT}/db/data/#{RAILS_ENV}/</tt>.

These methods should be called within the migration file, at the end of the +up+ and beginning of the +down+ method.  {See here}[http://blog.tammersaleh.com/pages/migration_data_dumper] for more info.
