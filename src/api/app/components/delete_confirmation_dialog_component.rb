# This component accepts these parameters:
# - modal_id: it is compulsory and should be unique, you have to pass it to the component and you can not use the
#             same id in two different calls to the component.
# - method: (the method or verb we use when submitting the form) it is compulsory.
# - action: (URL we send the form to) you either pass it to the component or is '#' by default because we are going to set it by JavaScript.
# - modal_title and confirmation_text: they are optional. Pass them only if you want to overwrite the default texts.
# - remote: It is an optional parameter. If not provided, it's going to be false by default.
